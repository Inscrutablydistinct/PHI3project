Question = """Your task is to identify the attributes/features of the metadata from a given user query. The attributes/features you need to identify are:

title
author
abstract
keywords
publication_date
arxiv_id
results

Note:
- All attributes except 'keywords' may or may not be present in the given query.
- If a query specifies a date, include "<", ">", ">=", "<=", "=" to denote before, after, after and on, before and on, and on the publication date, respectively.
- Separate the user query into the main query and the metadata attributes.
- If the query includes a metadata attribute term (e.g., author) without a specific name, include it in the main query instead of identifying it.
- The main query should not contain the identified metadata attributes.
- The 'abstract' attribute should be present in all, but it shouldn't be more than 20 words long.
- Give the answer at all costs.
